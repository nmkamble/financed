    </div>
    <div class = "topicSentence">
      <p> A budget is a financial plan for your income and expenses. It’s not a restriction on what you can spend but rather a plan for what you will do with your money. The purpose of a budget is to figure out if you have the money to do all the things you must do as well as all the things you want to do. With a proper budget and spending plan, you can prioritize different financial needs which can help you with things like paying off debt or keeping yourself out of debt</p> 
    </div>

          <h2>Key Components:</h2>
    <div class = "bullet1">
    <p><mark>INCOME:</mark> take an inventory of all of the money coming into your household</p>
    <p><mark>FIXED EXPENSES:</mark> take a look at all of your expenses that stay the same from month to month (ex: rent or utilities</p>
    <p><mark>FLEXIBLE EXPENSES:</mark> take a look at all of your expenses that change month to month (ex: clothing or food)</p>
    <p><mark>SET PRIORITIES:</mark> determine what expenses are important to you and which ones aren't</p>
    <p><mark>ESTABLISH A TIMELINE:</mark> figure out how much time you want to spend using your budget. For example, if you’re saving for a big purchase or vacation, your budget timeline may be shorter than someone who wants to pay off loan debt</p>

    <h2>Types of Budgets:</h2>
    <div class = "finalParagraph">
    <p>Now that you know what to pay attention to when creating a budget, you may be wondering what do with the information you’ve collected. There are many types of budgets and you may have to try different ones to figure out which one works best for you. But here are some of the most popular budgeting methods:</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "bullet1">
    <ul>
      <li><mark>Zero-based/Traditional Budget:</mark> every dollar you make is assigned to a specific spending category, like rent or food. If the money in the category is not completely used up, it can be rolled into a new category.</li>
      <li><mark>50/30/20:</mark> This budget follows the rule that 50% of income goes to essential items like rent, food, and bills, 30% goes towards personal expenses like shopping and dining, and 20% is put into savings. </li>
    </ul>
